This node connects to a single master and can subscibe and publish
to other nodes that are connected to it.
Multiple nodes with the same or different masters can be started
simultaneously, this allows for communication with multiple masters
and the creation of multiple services within the same process or repl.

Expects:
 client-host:string  The address of the machine the node runs on, in the masters network.
 master-host:string The adress of the machine running the ros master.
 master-port:number The port on which the master communicates.
 hosts:{string string} A hosts map that has the same function as the hosts file.
 name:string The name of the node.

Returns an atom storing all the connections state.
Which can then be used to publish and subscribe to topics."
